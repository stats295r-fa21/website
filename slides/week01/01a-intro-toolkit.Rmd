class: middle 

By the end of this course you should be able to adopt reproducible computing workflows in R for all your scientific work (e.g. data management, analysis, dissemination).

--

I may not teach you every single detail on the topic but you will gain enough foundations to tailor it to your future work.

my_age <- 2020 - birth_year

My_age
```

If something comes in quotes, it is not defined in R. 


```{r}

ages <- c(25, my_age, 32)

names <- c("Menglin", "Mine", "Rafael")

data.frame(age = ages, name = names)
```

---


## Vocabulary

```{r eval=FALSE}
do(something)
```

`do()` is a function;   
`something` is the argument of the function.
--

```{r eval=FALSE}
do(something, colorful)
```

`do()` is a function;   
`something` is the first argument of the function;   
`colorful` is the second argument of the function.

---

class: middle

## Getting Help

In order to get any help we can use `?` followed by function (or object) name. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
?c
```

After function names do not leave any spaces.

Before and after operators (e.g. <-, =) leave spaces. 

Put a space after a comma, **not** before. 

Object names are all lower case, with words separated by an underscore.

## Slides

Slides that you are currently looking at are also written in R Markdown. You can take a look at them on [GitHub repo](https://github.com/stats295r-fa21/website/tree/master/slides) for the course website. They are made with xaringan package which we will talk more about later.

### Art of commit messages that is learned with practice

**Commit often** but not too often. If in doubt, commit often.

## Cloning a repo

**repo** is a short form of repository. Repositories contain all of your project's files as well as each file's revision history.

For this class our weekly repos (lecture code, quiz code etc.) are hosted on Github. 

To **clone** a GitHub repo to our computer, we first copy the cloning link as shown in screencast then start an RStudio project using that link.  

**Cloning** a repo pulls (downloads) all the elements of a repo available at that specific time. 

---

class: middle

## Commits

Once you make changes to your repo (e.g. take notes during lecture, answer a quiz question). you can take a snapshot of your changes with a commit.

This way if you ever have to go back in version history you have your older commits to get back to. 
This is especially useful, for instance, if you want to go back to an earlier solution you have committed.

---

class: middle

## Push

All the commits you make will initially be local (i.e. on your own computer). 

In order for me to see your commits and your final submission on any assignment, you have to **push** your commits. In other words upload your files at the stage in that specific time.

## (An incomplete) Git/GitHub glossary

**Git:** is software for tracking changes in any set of files

**GitHub:** is an internet host for Git projects.

**repo:** is a short form of repository. Repositories contain all of your project's files as well as each file's revision history.

**clone:** Cloning a repo **pulls** (downloads) all the elements of a repo available at that specific time. 

**commit:** A snapshot of your repo at a specific point in time. We distinguish each commit with a **commit message**. 

**push:** Uploads the latest "committed" state of your repo to GitHub.
