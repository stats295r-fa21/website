.font75[Aggregating Categorical Data]

---

class: middle

Categorical data are summarized with **counts** or **proportions**

---

class: middle

```{r}
lapd %>% 
  count(employment_type)
```


---

class: middle

```{r}
lapd %>% 
  count(employment_type) %>% 
  mutate(prop = n/sum(n))
```




---

## Mean


```{r}
summarize(lapd, 
          mean_base_pay = mean(base_pay))
```


---

class: middle

Recall that we use multiple functions such as `mean()` and `median` within the summarize function

```{r}
summarize(lapd,
          mean_base_pay = mean(base_pay),
          med_base_pay = median(base_pay))
```

---

class: inverse middle

.font75[Aggregating Data by Groups]

---

class: middle

`group_by()`

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/data-wrangle.003.jpeg")
```

`group_by()` separates the data frame by the groups. Any action following `group_by()` will be completed for each group separately.

class: middle

Q. What is the median salary for each employment type?

---

```{r}
lapd %>% 
  group_by(employment_type)
```

---

```{r}
lapd %>% 
  group_by(employment_type) %>% 
  summarize(med_base_pay = median(base_pay))
```

---

class: middle

We can also remind ourselves how many staff members there were in each group.

```{r}
lapd %>% 
  group_by(employment_type) %>% 
  summarize(med_base_pay = median(base_pay),
            count = n())
```

Note that `n()` does not take any arguments.

## Join Functions

`something_join(x, y)` All the join functions in dplyr package are in this fashion where x represents the first data frame and y represents the second data frame.



---

.panelset[
.panel[

.panel-name[x]

```{r}
songs
```


]

.panel[

.panel-name[y]

```{r}
albums
```


]

.panel[

.panel-name[left_join()]

```{r}
left_join(songs, albums, by = "album_name")
```

]

]

`left_join()` includes all rows from x



---

.panelset[
.panel[

.panel-name[x]

```{r}
songs
```


]

.panel[

.panel-name[y]

```{r}
albums
```


]

.panel[

.panel-name[right_join()]

```{r}
right_join(songs, albums, by = "album_name")
```

]

]

`right_join()` includes all rows from `y`

---

.panelset[
.panel[

.panel-name[x]

```{r}
songs
```


]

.panel[

.panel-name[y]

```{r}
albums
```


]

.panel[

.panel-name[inner_join()]

```{r}
inner_join(songs, albums, by = "album_name")
```

]

]

`inner_join()` includes all rows that are in x **and** y

---

.panelset[
.panel[

.panel-name[x]

```{r}

]

.panel[

.panel-name[full_join()]

```{r}
full_join(songs, albums, by = "album_name")
```

]

]

`full_join()` includes all rows that are in x **or** y

---
